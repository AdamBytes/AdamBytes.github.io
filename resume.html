      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am an experienced technology professional with a strong foundation in digital transformation strategy, agile project management, and IT leadership. I have spent many hours self-studying and achieved certifications in AI from Microsoft and other credentials through reputable universitites. I have experience in handling cloud platforms, learning & development, staff empowerment and system process reorganisation with the use of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been fortunate that over the years I've had the chance to lead and be a part of cross-functional initiatives, designed and adapted transformation frameworks and developed strategic assets that reflect the challenges faced by organisations looking to 'future-proof' themselves. My work has allowed me to tackel projects in education, IT and adopting emerging tech. I do believe that coming from a humanities background gives me a unique lens on how to build scalable, human-centered solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transformation is never fixed, and I believe that for every challenge faced, there is always another one waiting to show itself. All that means is that we are responsible for the change we want to see and we should be active in building it. Through mock blueprints, AI use case examples and cloud migration plans, I want to actively explore the kind of value-driven strategies that global companies need. My goal is to partner with forward-thinking organizations to co-create digital solutions that deliver measurable impact and long-term growth.
