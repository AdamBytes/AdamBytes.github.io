    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>I am educator turned digital strategist with a focus for empowering people through technology. Over the years, I’ve worn many hats: classroom teacher, educational technology director, transformation lead, systems thinker and digital transformationist, staff development trainer and process consultant. My work has spanned curriculum design, agile project management, IT leadership, and cross-functional team development; all rooted in a deep understanding of how people learn and adapt. This blog page serves as my documentation into learning and the fun of side my career journey and interests.I like to learn by doing, so I decided to build this blog from scratch using HTML and CSS — not just to learn the tools but to actually use them.</p>
    <p>I’ve led initiatives across education classrooms and in education organstions, working with tools like Microsoft PowerApps, Office 365, and a range of learning and content management systems. I focus on making systems work for people —not the other way around — I’m drawn to projects where strategy, execution, and empathy need to align.</p> 
    <p>This blog is a space where I share practical insights, experiments, and reflections from my work and learning experiences. I’m currently expanding my technical expertise through hands on projects in Python, cybersecurity,GRC while continuing to work and consult globally.</p>
