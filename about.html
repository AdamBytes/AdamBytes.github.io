    <h2>Welcome World</h2>
    <p>This is my github site - a collection of curiosities and learning pathways. This github site will have reports from Hack the Box as I work through them, my professional resume and blog posts - expect it to be unfocused as it finds its feet.</p>
    <p>My name is Craig. In the last six months I’ve travelled to the following countries: Portugal, Italy, Greece, Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, Austria and Slovenia. Before that I was a terrible competitive powerlifter and very mediocre runner. And before that, I was a Dota 2 scrub. And before that, I loved making DIY projects at home.</p>
    <p>I think one person can have many hats, these are just some of my favourite ones - that and an innate obsession with many different ways an egg can be used. At the moment, I am looking to change hats again, but in a professional capacity. I have decided to take the plunge and finally immerse myself fully into the digital and cyber world - after having turned down many opportunities before to enter into this space, I believe now it’s the right move.</p>
    <p>Welcome to my experimental github page. Feel free to take a look at my resume, my learnings on HTB or the (infrequent) blog posts.</p>
