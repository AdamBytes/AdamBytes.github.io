    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>I am educator turned digital strategist with a passion for empowering people through technology. Over the years, I’ve worn many hats: classroom teacher, edtech director, transformation lead, systems thinker and digital transformationist. My work has spanned curriculum design, agile project management, IT leadership, and cross-functional team development—all rooted in a deep understanding of how people learn and adapt. This is the blog page serves as my documentation into learning and the fun of side my job. I like to learn by doing, so I decided to build this blog from using HTML and CSS — not just to learn the tools, but to actually use them</p>
    <p>I’ve led initiatives across education and enterprise settings, working with tools like Microsoft PowerApps, Office 365, and a range of learning and content management systems. I focus on making systems work for people—not the other way around—and I’m drawn to projects where strategy, execution, and empathy need to align.</p> 
    <p>This blog is a space where I share practical insights, experiments, and reflections from my work. I’m currently expanding my technical experience through hands on projects in Python, cybersecurity, while continuing to work and consult globally.</p>
