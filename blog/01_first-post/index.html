            <h2>My Journey into the Digital World ðŸ’»</h2>
            <p>Thank you for joining me on this path. This blog is driven by two main motivations: to <strong>capture my learning in various areas of ICT</strong>, including cybersecurity, digital transformation, GRC, and security, and to <strong>put that learning into practice</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Brushing Up on HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p>To kick things off, I wanted to refresh my skills in <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>. I've experimented with both in the past, mainly to build simple websites and understand how webpages are constructed. For this blog, I was looking for a minimalist reading experience, as many pre-made themes didn't suit my taste.</p>
            <p>Using a combination of my existing knowledge and some assistance from <strong>Generative AI</strong>, I developed this simple blog format. The goal was to create static pages that could easily capture my experiences and learning.</p>

            <h2>Choosing GitHub as a Digital Portfolio</h2>
            <p>I decided to host this project on <strong>GitHub</strong> because I've been eager to get some hands-on experience with it. I thought it would be the perfect space to serve as a <strong>digital portfolio</strong> and act as an archive of my work as I continue to navigate the digital world.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned ðŸ§ </h2>
            <p>This project was a lot of fun, and it was great to recall my knowledge of HTML and CSS. Using GenAI to help me troubleshoot and understand where I was going wrong was particularly interesting. While I know this may not be the most efficient way to maintain a blog, it's a valuable framework for me to cut my teeth on, and I plan to make changes as I go.</p>
            <p>This process also taught me the importance of refining my <strong>prompt generation</strong> and carefully working on code before committing it. It's easy to get lazy, but taking that extra time makes a huge difference.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>The Value of Doing</h2>
            <p>As much fun as it is to learn with AI, the <strong>core element of learning is to actually do</strong>. This is a notion I've carried from my years as an educator, where I always encouraged my students to get their hands dirty and build something themselves. The practical application is where the real learning happens.</p>
