    <h2>HTB: Synced</h2>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 13th September 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Lab Objective:</strong> ‘Synced’ is a Tier 0 machine in the Starting Point series. This lab focuses on the Rsync protocol. Rsync (Remote Sync) is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files between a computer and a storage drive and across networked computers by comparing the modification times and sizes of files.</p>

    <h3>Important Considerations</h3>
    <p><strong>Port</strong>: Port 873 TCP is the default port used by Rsync. It can be used for local and remote file-copying.</p>
    <p><strong>Configuration</strong>: Rsync uses "modules" which are essentially directory shares. These can be configured with or without authentication. In a professional environment, allowing anonymous access to these modules can lead to significant data leaks.</p>
    <p><strong>Security</strong>: Similar to the Telnet issues found in Meow, Rsync does not provide encryption by default during transport unless it is tunneled through a protocol like SSH. If misconfigured, an attacker can list, read, and sometimes write files to the server without a password.</p>
    
    <h3>Enumeration</h3>
    <p>As always, we need to start with enumeration. This involves gathering information about the target system to identify what services are exposed. Skipping this step often leads to rabbit holes and wasted time.</p>

    

    <p><strong>Task 1 - What is the default port for rsync?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: 873</p>
    <p><code>sudo nmap -sV [TARGET_IP]</code></p>
    
    <p><strong>Task 2 - How many TCP ports are open on the remote host?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: 1</p>
        
    <p><strong>Task 3 - What is the protocol version used by rsync on the remote host?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: 31</p>
        
    <p><strong>Task 4 - What is the command used to list the modules available on the target?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: <code>rsync --list-only</code></p>
    <p>To interact with this service, ensure you have the rsync client installed on your local machine. You can install it using: <code>sudo apt install rsync</code>.</p>

   <h3>Establishing a foothold</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Task 5: What is the name of the share (module) that is available on the target?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: <code>public</code></p>
    <p>I used the command <code>rsync --list-only [TARGET_IP]::</code> to see what was available. The double colon <code>::</code> is used to contact the rsync daemon directly.</p>
        
    <p><strong>Task 6: What is the command to list the contents of the 'public' share?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: <code>rsync [TARGET_IP]::public</code></p>
    
    <p><strong>Task 7: What is the name of the file found inside the share?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: <code>flag.txt</code></p>
    <p>Once the file was identified, I needed to "sync" it to my local machine to read it. I used the command:</p>
    <p><code>rsync [TARGET_IP]::public/flag.txt .</code></p>
    <p>The <code>.</code> indicates that I want the file copied to my current working directory.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                    
    <p><strong>Task 8: Submit the Flag</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: [The hash found inside flag.txt]</p>
    
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <ul>
      <li>Rsync is a powerful tool, but dangerous when the "Anonymous" login is left enabled on sensitive directories.</li>
      <li>The <code>--list-only</code> flag is your best friend when enumerating unknown rsync targets.</li>
      <li>Always check for "modules" before trying to guess file paths.</li>
    </ul>
