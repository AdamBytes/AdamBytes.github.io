    <h2>HTB: Mongod</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> 5 January 2026</p>

      <p><strong>Lab Objective:</strong> ‘Mongod’ is the seventh machine in the Start Point – Tier 0’ series on HTB that comes with VIP access.</p>
      <p>In this case, we explore MongoDB. MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database and has the following hierarchy: databases; collections and documents. For simplicity sake, databases are organised into collections which contain documents. These documents contain data in the format of strings, numbers, dates in a JSON-like format. </p>

    <h3>Important Considerations</h3>
      <p>I will make it very apparent that I used the Walkthrough extensively throughout this lab as I had no prior knowledge of MongoDB nor its system access level and the kind of exploits that could take place. I detail my observation and self-learning process under final thoughts at the end of this write-up.</p>
      <p>What is important to understand is that misconfiguration typically leads to vulnerabilities in most environments. In this case, we are taking advantage of a misconfigured system to gain an anonymous login and then retrieve the respective flag. </p>
      <p>I learnt that the ‘Mongosh’ command line utility was very important here. Below are the steps to enumerate and then take a foothold in the server. </p>

    <h3>Enumeration</h3>
      <p>As always, we need to start with enumeration (gathering information) as it is the first and most critical step in penetration testing. This would involve gathering information about the target system by slowly mapping out key vulnerabilities - it’s making an assessment. Skipping this step can lead to missed vulnerabilities and wasted time. In this case, we start by using Nmap.</p>
      <p>With the help of the walkthrough, it was found that we had to use <code>nmap -p- --min-rate-1000 -sV {TARGET-IP}</code></p>
      <p>We add the extra conditionals to the command to make sure that it scans ports 0-65535; determines the versions of the running services and the minimum number of packets that Nmap should send per second. </p>


  <p><strong>Task 1: How many TCP ports are open on the machine?</strong></p>
  <p>Answer: 2</p>
 
  <p><strong>Task 2: Which service is running on Port 27017 of the remote host?</strong></p>
  <p>Answer: MongoDB 3.6.8</p>
       
  <p><strong>Task 3: What type of database is MongoDB (ChooseL SQL or NoSQL)</strong></p>
  <p>Answer: NoSQL</p>

  <p><strong>Task 4: What command is used to launch the interactive MongoDB shell from the terminal?</strong></p>
  <p>Answer: <code>mongosh</code></p>
     
  <p><strong>Task 5: What is the command used for listing all the databases present on the MongoDB server? (No need to include a training)</strong></p>
  <p>Answer: <code>show dbs</code></p>
 
  <p><strong>Task 6: Task 6: What is the command used for listing out the collections in a database?</strong></p>
  <p>Answer: <code>show collections</code></p>
    
  <p><strong>Task 7: What command is used to dump the content of all the documents within the collection named <code>flag</code>?</strong></p>
  <p>Answer: <copde>db.flag.find()</copde></p>

  <p><strong>Task 8: Submit the Flag</strong></p>
  <p>Answer: Please follow the instructions to find the respective flag. </p>

  
   <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I didn’t enjoy the feeling of not knowing what I was doing and a reliance on the guide walkthrough. </li>
        <li>However, I took it as a learning opportunity to be exposed to something new. I will not always know everything all the time, especially so early on in my learning. </li>
        <li>I thought about the ways in which I would think about how to engage more meaningfully on areas or labs that I will have no knowledge on and there are a couple steps I can take to assist me. </li>
        <li>The final lesson I learnt today was that if a service is connected to the internet with the default settings, no ‘hacking’ is required, only the right client tool.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Enumeration is important, it lets me understand the respective services runnong on a host and instead of feeling overwhemled, I should consider using altenrative sources like Google or committ to doing some service research. I should also spend some time making sold and valid attempts in documenting the process and how I deal and engage with it meaningfully.</p>
