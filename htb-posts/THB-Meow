    <h2>HTB: Meow</h2>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 13 September 2025</p>
    <p>Meow is the beginning of the Starting Point process on Hack the Box labs. The learning outcomes for the Starting Point program is gain the fundamental skills for pen-testing. In these tutorials, we learn to connect to various services such as FTP, SFTP, SMB, Telnet, RSync and RDP anonymously.</p>
    <p>We also learn tools such as NMap, the Bash (terminal) console and learning how to communicate with machines and find vulnerabilities.</p>
    <h3>Enumeraton</h3>
    <p>As a core process for any kind of pen-testing, we need to spend time gathering information from a client or a target system - this is first step and can save us a lot of time and hassle so we need to make sure that we don't overlook anything crucial. </p>
    
<h3>Start Process</h3>
    <p>I knew from my experience in working with computers in my home environment and workplace, that Ping was the tool to let us know if the target host was reachable. I tried Ping [TARGET IP] and found that it was returning the ping. Though I have little experience with Linux (in this case Parrot OS) I didn't know the command to Ping for X number of times nor how to cancel it. After a quick Google I found the cancel function was Ctrl + C and to initiate a N number of times I needed to use -c.</p>
    <Nmap Scans>
    <p>I had read about NMap in working through some of the HTB material and also my CompTIA learning material and was familiar with it as a whole. In short, NMAP is a Network Mapper that is used for scanning and host discovery. It has several features such as Network Discovery, Port Scanning, OS Fingerprinting, Vulnerability Assessment and Network Monitoring.</p> 
    <p>I learnt two commands from this process: sudo nmap -sV [IP Address] and sudo nmap -Pn [IP] </p>
      <ul>
        <li>sudo nmap -sV: this command scans for open ports and attempts to identify service versions</li>
        <li>sudo nmap -Pn: this skips host discovery and assumes the host is up. It's useful when ICMP is blocked by firewalls.</li>
      </ul>
  <p>From scanning the IP address I was able to figure out that it was a Telnet service and that it was open on Port 23.</p>
<h3>Telnet: Connecting to the Box</h3>
<p>Telnet is a protocol that is used to connect to remote machines via a CLI (command line interface). The command is telnet [IP address]. It then requires a username and password combination. I recalled that telnet is a rather unsecure service and just typed in a variation of an admin username (i.e. admin, administrator, root) and the same username as the password and it let me in.</p>
<p>After Googling to explore the nature of unsecure username and passwords, I discovered that this is where one can use a Brute Force attack by using a script or tool.<\p>
<p>As an aside, I was reading on login authentication and thought that encoding Telnet with base64 would improve security (encryption) but it doesn't. Telnet transmits data in plain text. This means that anyone can intercept it and can read the informaiton directly. If someone is familiar with bsae64 encoding, they could easily decode it.</p>
<p>Once I was inside Telnet I need to familirise myself with options of Telnet and I typed in help or '?'. Having worked in a terminal before, I found that 'ls' was the command to list all the files in the directory. I then explored further and found the following commands:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ls -l: this is the long list format</p>
    <li>ls -a: this includes hidden files</p>
</ul>
<p> I noticed that there was a file titled 'flag.txt'. I needed to be able to read this file and used cat flag.txt and it presented my hash value to complete the room.</p>
<h3>Final Thougts</h3>
  <p>This was my first interaction with pen-testing and it was fun to learn the basics. In this case I walked away with knowing how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> How to identify and connect to services.</li>
  <li> The importance of enumeration</li>
  <li> Basic Linux navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a simple start but it lays with the groundwork for more complex challenges ahead.</p>
