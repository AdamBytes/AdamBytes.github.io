    <h2>HTB: Meow</h2>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 13 September 2025</p>

    <p>Meow is the beginning of the Starting Point process on Hack The Box labs. The learning outcomes for the Starting Point program are to gain fundamental skills for penetration testing. In these tutorials, we learn to connect to various services such as FTP, SFTP, SMB, Telnet, RSync, and RDP anonymously.</p>

    <p>We also learn tools such as Nmap, the Bash terminal, and how to communicate with machines and identify vulnerabilities.</p>

    <h3>Enumeration</h3>
    <p>As a core process for any kind of penetration testing, we need to spend time gathering information from a client or target system. This is the first step and can save us a lot of time and hassle, so we need to make sure we don't overlook anything crucial.</p>

    <h3>Start Process</h3>
    <p>From my experience working with computers at home and in the workplace, I knew that Ping was the tool to check if the target host was reachable. I tried <em>ping [TARGET IP]</em> and confirmed it was returning responses. Though I had little experience with Linux (in this case, Parrot OS), I didn’t know how to ping a specific number of times or how to cancel it. After a quick search, I found that Ctrl + C cancels the ping, and <em>-c</em> specifies the count.</p>

    <h3>Nmap Scans</h3>
    <p>I had read about Nmap in HTB materials and my CompTIA coursework. In short, Nmap is a network mapper used for scanning and host discovery. It supports features like network discovery, port scanning, OS fingerprinting, vulnerability assessment, and network monitoring.</p>

    <p>I learned two useful commands:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>sudo nmap -sV [IP Address]</strong>: Scans for open ports and attempts to identify service versions.</li>
      <li><strong>sudo nmap -Pn [IP Address]</strong>: Skips host discovery and assumes the host is up. Useful when ICMP is blocked by firewalls.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>From scanning the IP address, I discovered that a Telnet service was open on port 23.</p>

    <h3>Telnet: Connecting to the Box</h3>
    <p>Telnet is a protocol used to connect to remote machines via a command line interface. The command is <em>telnet [IP address]</em>. It then prompts for a username and password. Knowing Telnet is insecure, I tried common usernames like <em>admin</em>, <em>administrator</em>, and <em>root</em>—and using the same for the password. It let me in.</p>

    <p>After researching insecure credentials, I learned that brute force attacks can be used with scripts or tools to guess login combinations. I also explored whether encoding Telnet with base64 would improve security—but it doesn’t. Telnet transmits data in plain text, meaning anyone can intercept and read it. Base64 is just encoding, not encryption, and can be easily decoded.</p>

    <p>Once inside Telnet, I familiarised myself with its options using <em>help</em> and <em>?</em>. I used <em>ls</em> to list files in the directory and discovered these useful commands:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ls -l</strong>: Displays files in long list format.</li>
      <li><strong>ls -a</strong>: Includes hidden files.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I noticed a file named <em>flag.txt</em>. I used <em>cat flag.txt</em> to read it, and it revealed the hash value needed to complete the room.</p>

    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>This was my first interaction with penetration testing, and it was exciting to learn the basics. I walked away with a better understanding of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How to identify and connect to services</li>
      <li>The importance of enumeration</li>
      <li>Basic Linux navigation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It’s a simple start, but it lays the groundwork for more complex challenges ahead.</p>
