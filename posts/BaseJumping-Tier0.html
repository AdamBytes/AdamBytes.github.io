    <h2>BaseJumping Tier 0</h2>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 14 January 2026</p>

    <h3>Learning to fly</h3>

    <p>HTB is an interesting experience.  My typical behaviour is to speed ahead, even if I don’t know something as I will generally figure it out later down the line. Structured learning has always been painful. </p>
    <P>But this time, I wanted to try something different as my general knowledge and understanding in this field is merely a smidgen.</P>
    <P>I wanted to avoid the temptation of falling into the fantasy of being a ‘pro-hacker’. When one puts the ego aside, you soon begin to understand that looking for vulnerabilities is about patience, and exercising your own. I read somewhere that for an hour of hacking, you spend ten minutes breaking into the system and 50 minutes in enumeration.</P>
    <P>I am glad that I spent a very slow and deliberate effort in working through Tier 0, and also spending time reading through and understanding the walkthroughs. Instead of skipping the tutorial, and despite my typical learning instinct, I worked through this tier slowly and very deliberately. </P>
    <p>This tier is Foundational.</p>

     <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Connection</strong> - Tier 0 demonstrates how data moves. Gaining access to instances of Telnet, SMB, or FTP isn’t something amazing—it’s most likely human error with some misconfiguration or something that was never addressed at deployment. Like making a first impression, giving the correct handshake is more important than running the script.</li>
      <li><strong>Knowing your tool</strong> - Anyone can copy-paste an nmap command. Tier 0 teaches you to read the instance of what you are doing. It’s almost like flirting I guess, you need to interpret service versions and port states early on to prevent "rabbit holes" later in more complex tiers.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteThingsDown</strong> - I really started AdamBytes as an opportunity to capture my learnings for potential employment but I have gained a lot more than I thought I would initially. I’ve become quite good at stabilising my thoughts and structuring them into easily readable instances. It’s also a great way to remember where to look for certain instances of things I forgot - I can see some edits later down the line that will help.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Doughnut sitting</strong> - If you spend 10 minutes hacking, you should have spent 40 minutes researching.</li>
      <li><strong>1RepMax</strong> - The "Exploit" phase is the shortest part of the process; the recon is where the work happens.Basically, the entire process of your Doughtnut Sitting should prepare you well enough to 1 max your exploit.</li>
    </ul>

     <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
    <p>Right now, I am watching videos on PenTesting, learning some software and finishing my course on Cybersecurity from Google on Coursera. I’ve also installed Fedora as a dual boot to my system to get familiar with Bash and Linux as a whole again. I’ve also flashed my laptop to run Kali - thinking of putting it into a VM and putting POP! OS as my daily driver on that. Also exploring some HomeLab ideas.</p>
    <p>Basically - beside the structured studying, everything else is going on Whimsy.</p>
