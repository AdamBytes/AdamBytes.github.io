      <h3>Over the Wire</h3>
      <p>This will be a long continuous page until I complete the Over the Wire War Games labs. This will be largerly exploratory as I learn new concepts, develop new skills and infer new understanding</p>
      <p>In developing these writeups, I hope to further develop my capacity to write and to get familiar with explaining technical concepts.</p>

      <h3>WarGames: Level 0</h3>
      <p>I read the helpful reading material supplied as I was new the environment - I wanted to make sure I did not make any mistakes</p>
      <p>I attempted to download Cygwin but my connection was slow. I then attempted to connect through the Windows terminal and that was successful</p>
      <p>Upon reading documentation, there are two ways to log into SSH:</p>
      <li>
        <ul><code>ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -1 bandit0 -p 2220</code></ul>
        <ul><code>ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220</code></ul>        
      </li>
      <p>The first concept of this exercise was to login successfully through the CLI and with Secure Shell Socket, the difference here was that it also required the end user to login through a different port as opposed to the default.</p>
      <p>Mission objective was to log into the remove machin. </p>
